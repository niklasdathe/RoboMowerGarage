# The Story of the Lawn Mower Garage  

This is the story of how I ended up building *two* garages for my parents’ robotic lawn mower.

## Chapter 1: 2018 — A 15-Year-Old With a Table Saw  

The year was 2018. I was 15, freshly armed with my very first table saw (the cheap kind you get for Christmas, but hey—it had a blade and spun, so it counted). At the same time, my parents had just bought a shiny new robotic lawn mower.  

The charging station had to be placed right in the middle of our front lawn, which immediately raised the obvious problem: theft. My solution? Build a *garage* for the mower—complete with an automatic, mechanically closing door.  

Somehow, I convinced my dad to let me run with this “Mission Impossible” plan, and one day later I had all the materials I thought I needed. My priorities were crystal clear:  
- It had to be stylish.  
- It had to involve wood (because, again, I had that new table saw).  
- And above all: it had to *work*.  

The concept was simple but effective: a counterweight keeps the door open, and as soon as the mower enters, the weight pulls the door shut behind it.  

So I spent a few days of my holidays tinkering away. I sewed little sandbags to serve as weights, added a green roof so plants could grow on top (because why not?), and crossed my fingers.  

To my surprise, it actually worked. To my even bigger surprise, it kept working for years.

## Chapter 2: 2025 — The Garage Strikes Back  

Fast-forward to today. It’s 2025. The first garage, built from pine and plywood, has been sitting directly on dirt in northern German weather for *seven years*. Predictably, it started disintegrating into something resembling garden compost.  

By now, though, I’d gone to engineering school. And naturally, my first thought was: *I can do this better.*  

So once again, I convinced my dad. Only this time, no compromises.

## Chapter 3: Version 2.0 — Built to Last  

I fired up Fusion and designed a brand-new garage—same footprint, but with way better materials:  
- **Aluminum extrusions** for the frame.  
- **Reclaimed bankirai decking boards** for the cladding.  

Planing those boards with my cheap 1980s jointer-planer dulled the blades not once, not twice, but three times. Bankirai wood is basically made of stone, but I was committed.  

Then came the fun part: I ordered the extrusions online and sourced a hefty steel counterweight. The counterweight now hangs neatly thanks to custom 3D-printed holders. For the door pivot, I went with… cheap skater bearings. Because why not let extreme sports technology handle it?

## Epilogue  

And there it is: the lawn mower garage is back in business, stronger and fancier than ever. Hopefully, Version 3 won’t be needed for a long time—unless, of course, the mower itself demands an upgrade to a *fully automated smart garage with Wi-Fi and app support*.  

But that’s a problem for future me.
